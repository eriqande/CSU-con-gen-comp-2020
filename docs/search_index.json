CSU FWCB/BZ 5XX Instructors: Eric C. Anderson and Kristen C. Ruegg Site Last Updated: 2020-01-30 Course Overview Welcome to the course web page for Advanced Computing and Bioinformatics for Conservation Genomics, an experimental course being offered for the first time in Winter Semester 2020. We will be covering computing, analysis and data-organization strategies for bioinformatics and analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for ecology, evolution, and conservation. Modern high-throughput sequencing can provide extraordinary amounts of data, enabling researchers to tackle a wide range of questions and problems in ecology, evolution, conservation, and fisheries and wildlife management. Preparing and processing these data for use, however, requires multiple bioinformatic steps, and subsequent analysis of these large, complex data sets must rely on specialized computer programs. Mastering these skills presents a high bar for students originating from outside of computer science and related fields. At present, in many institutions, such skills are typically learned from peers within experienced laboratories, or through a variety of workshops. This course aims to comprehensively teach the computing and analytical skills necessary to use genomic data from high-throughput sequencing in the context of ecological research. During the first 2/3 of the course, the focus is on aligning DNA sequence data and identifying variants across multiple individuals. In the last 1/3 of the course we consider a series of case studies in how such data are used to make inference for applications in fisheries, wildlife, and conservation. Outside of the bioinformatic utilities that run within a Unix framework, emphasis is placed on using the R programming language and RStudio for project management and documentation. The proposed course topics appear, by week, in the table below. Each week of the course is structured as a different chapter in the navigation panel on the left. In order to figure out what we are doing in the course each week, that will be the first place to check. The week’s objectives, readings, and exercises will be listed there. Course schedule The course schedule is: Tu,Th 11:00-12:15 in BIO 133. Lectures Wed 8:00-9:50 in BIO 133. Discussion/Computer lab Students are expected to have a laptop. Course Learning Objectives Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to: Organize and execute a complex bioinformatic data-analysis project in a manner that makes it easily understood and reproduced by others. Describe the main data formats used in genomic analysis, and know how to generate and manipulate them. Work with a wide range of the bioinformatic tools available in the Unix environment and understand how to script these tools into pipelines for DNA sequence alignment, variant calling, and analysis. Understand how to break down complex genomic analysis projects into small, independent chunks and execute those using job arrays on a high performance computing cluster. Perform a variety of computational analyses central to conservation genetics. Assessment Assessment will be based mostly on weekly problem sets. These will sometimes require considerable time and thought, but they will be critical for solidifying the concepts and procedures in the course. Students will also be undertaking individual projects in which they apply the skills they have learned in the course to a data set relevant in some way to their own research or to an interesting question relevant to some existing data, after discussion with the instructors (see below). Finally, students are expected to contribute to discussion and participation in the course, including (and most importantly) being helpful to one another in order to learn challenging material, together, in a supportive environment. “It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.” -–- Napolean Hill Assessment Component Percentage of Grade Problem sets 60% Individual analysis projects 30% Class participation 10% Weekly Schedule The schedule is subject to change as the semester proceeds, but this is what we are shooting for. Week Lecture Component Lab Component 1 Rstudio Projects, GitHub Rmarkdown, git and GitHub 2 Unix, directory structure, utilities Unix, data compression 3 Next generation sequencing, alignment conventions, FASTA, SAM Samtools (faidx) 4 Shell scripting, regular expressions, sed and awk Shell scripting and awk 5 Remote computers, ssh, rclone, HPC, SLURM, SGE Connecting to Summit Cluster 6 Sequence alignment, job arrays, parallelization over individuals bwa, samtools (sort, merge, cat, index) 7 Variant calling – I, fundamental concepts GATK, Base quality score recalibration 8 Variant calling – II, parallelization over regions GATK, gVCFs, VCFs 9 Variant Filtering, manipulation, exploration, LD and pop-gen statistics bcftools, bedtools, R package ‘whoa’, plink 10 Restriction-associated digest (RAD) sequencing STACKS2, R package ‘radiator’ 11 Visualization of genomic data in space R packages: ‘ggplot’, ‘sf’ 12 Visualization of genomic data: trees R packages: ‘ape’, ‘ggtree’ 13 Population structure R package ‘srsStuff’ 14 Inbreeding, runs of homozygosity bcftools roh, plink 15 Genome wide association studies ANGSD, snpEff 16 Genotype-environment association Gradient Random Forest, RDA Individual Projects The purpose of the individual projects is to allow the students to use many of the skills learned, and to gain experience in preparing a reproducible research project. Some students likely already have their own data sets that they are working on, but we expect that many will not. We will be able to provide data and interesting questions to tackle from our own research. Additionally, we will encourage students to take on related projects so that they can work together on different parts of a single question. Course GitHub Organization A large part of this course will entail getting familiar with git and GitHub. Homework assignments will be distributed via GitHub Classroom. The resulting repositories for all students can be found in the CSU-con-gen-bioinformatics-2020 GitHub Organization page at https://github.com/CSU-con-gen-bioinformatics-2020. "],

Not to mention the fact that R is not typically central to hard-core bioinformatic tasks in a Unix environment. However, bear with us. Using RStudio sets you up with a great mechanism for recording your work in RMarkdown Notebooks, it provides a natural way to organize projects, it makes it trivial to keep your work version-controlled, and finally, when you have done all your bioinformatics, it is great for analysis of and figure preparation from the generated data in the R language. This week is mostly about getting everyone’s laptop configured to use RStudio, to compile RMarkdown documents, and to use git and GitHub which are necessary for getting and submitting the homework assignments in this course. 1.1 Lecture Slides setting-up-your-system.html (For Tuesday) git-and-github.html (For Thursday) Required Readings Download the RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet. Study it and keep it close by on your computer for frequent reference. (Read it Before/During Tuesday’s class). Download the RStudio Rmarkdown Cheat Sheet and peruse it before Wednesday’s Computer lab session. Recommended Readings Chapter 8 of R for Data Science.
