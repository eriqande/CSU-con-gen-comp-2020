## Rmarkdown Leftovers I: RMarkdown documents vs R Notebooks

### Typical output formats

Most output formats from RMarkdown, like:

* `html_document`
* `word_document`
* `pdf_document`
* etc.

use the `knitr` model for evaluating code and "knitting" the document
to produce output.

Basically: if you want to see the HTML (or PDF or WORD) output, you
need to hit the "knit" button which will:

1. evaluate all the code (in a completely fresh, new R Session)
2. compile up the results with the markdown to make the document.

This can be exceedingly slow if you just made a small tweak to the
text or formatting and you want to see the result.

Enter the `html_notebook` output format, or **R Notebook**...

### R Notebook (`html_notebook`) output

YAML header:
```
---
title: "A Title"
output: html_notebook
---
```

instead of 

```
---
title: "A Title"
output: html_document
---
```


* No "knit" button, just a "Preview" Button.
* You evaluate the code like normal R code in an _ongoing_ R session.
* RStudio stores the output for each chunk in the `.Rproj.user` folder (in a rather complicated system...)
* When you want to see what output looks like, the "Preview" button renders the markdown into HTML, while inserting whatever R results
are already stored.
* You can get output much faster because no R is being evaluated while rendering.
* Much better for interactive work.
* `df_print: paged` enabled by default
* Danger of not being as reproducible, but check that with: "Run -> Restart R and Run All Chunks"










## Rmarkdown Leftovers II: Code Blocks, for Evaluation or Show?

### Evaluated Code

If if put this in your document:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x <- 1:10
```
````

````markdown
`r ''````{bash}
PS1='[\W]--% '
```
````

Then the code within the blocks get _evaluated_.  In the first case it
is evaluated in R, and in the second it get evaluated in a bash shell.

### Non-evaluated code (code for show only!)

But what if you just want to document a snippet of code, but don't
actually want to to run it in your RMarkdown document (I do this
all the time when documenting short scripts I wrote quickly on a
cluster or when just noodling at the command line.  There are two
options:

#### eval=FALSE option

Just add `eval=FALSE` as an option to the code block:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
```
````

````markdown
`r ''````{bash, eval=FALSE}
PS1='[\W]--% '
```
````

**Advantages**

* The block still shows up with a gray background in the RStudio
editor, making it easy to see where it starts and ends.
* It plays better with indenting within lists (i.e. you are displaying
code within a list and you want the edge of the code indented with the list, then you can indent the whole block)
* Note, even if you don't evaluate it, you want to say what
type of code it is (`r` or `sh`, etc.) so that the syntax highlighing
occurs correctly

**Disadvantages**

* It requires a little extra typing.
* It still has the little "evaluate-me" arrow which might
lead you to evaluate it while playing with your notebook, even
though you don't want to.

#### The "no-curly-braces" option

Write it as a regular markdown "non-evaluated" chunk.

````markdown
`r ''````r
x <- 1:10
```
````

````markdown
`r ''````bash
PS1='[\W]--% '
```
````

Note that you still tell it what language is used, immediately
after the back-tick.  That tells it how to do the syntax
highlighting.

**Advantages**

* Less typing.
* The lack of gray background in the editor window let's you
know it is not intended for evaluation.
* You can't accidentally evaluate it.

## All your cheat sheets in one document

RStudio has all (or most) of its 2019 Cheat Sheets in one spot here:
[https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf)

Great for a mind-blowing introduction to a lot of the new stuff coming
from RStudio.


## Git Basics.  Overview

Goals for Today:

* Explain what git is (and how it is different than GitHub)
* Introduce the sha-1 hash (for fun!)
* Get familiar with RStudio's very convenient interface to git
    + staging files
    + unstaging file
    + viewing differences between staged and unstaged files
    + committing files
    + viewing the commit history
 * Practice forking

## An overview of Version Control Systems (VCS) {#vcs}

* Git is a type of VCS
* At its crudest, a VCS is a system that provides a way of saving
and restoring earlier versions of a file.

### A typical VCS for a non-computer programmer

* Start writing `my_manuscript.doc`.
* At some point worry that MS Word is going to eat your file, so,
    + Make a "backup" called `my_manuscript_A.doc`
* Then, before overhauling the discussion, save the current file as
`my_manuscript_B.doc`. 
* Email it to your coauthors and then have a series of files with other
extensions such as the initials of their names when they edit them and send
them back.
* Etc.
* Disadvantages:
    + Hard to find a good record of what is in each version.  (Wait! I liked the introduction
    I wrote three weeks ago...where is that now?)
    + A terrible system if you have multiple files that are dependent on one another
    (for example, figures in your document, or scripts and data sets if you have a 
    programming project.)
    + If you decide that you want to merge the changes you made to the discussion in version `_C`
    with the edits on the introduction in version `_K`, it is hard.

### Other popular VCS systems

* rcs, cvs, subversion, etc.
* These all had a "Centralized" model:
    + You set up a repository on a server that has the full version history, 
    + then each person working on it gets a copy of the current version, and nothing more.
    + They can submit changes back to the central repository which tries to deal with conflicting
    submissions.
    + You need to be online to do most operations.
* I used a few of these, and missed them for a few weeks when I switched to Git, but 
then never looked back and couldn't imagine using them again.


## The Git model --- Distributed Version Control

* Git stores "snapshots" of your collection of files in a repository
* For our work, the "collection of files" will be "the stuff in an RStudio project"
    + Another reason it is nice to keep everything you need for a project together in a "project directory"
    + Though git scans your project directory for new additions and changes, it will not
      add a new file, or add new changes, to the repository until you _stage_ and subsequently 
      _commit_ the file. 
* When you clone a repository, __you__ get the whole version history 
* When someone else clones that repository, __they also__ get the whole version history.
* Git has well-developed features for merging changes made in different repositories
    + But, for today, we will talk mostly of a single user interacting with git.
* Tell Cormac's story about Linus Torvalds developing git over a weekend.

## Git versus GitHub

* They are not the same thing!
* Git is software that you can run on your own machine for doing version control on a repository.
    + It can be _entirely_ local.  i.e. only on your hard drive and nowhere else.
    + This is super-useful for any project, because solid version control is great to have.
* GitHub is a website, with tools powered by Git (and many that they brewed up themselves) that
makes it very, very easy to share git repositories with people all over the place.

### Is everything on GitHub public?

* No!  Many companies use GitHub to host their proprietary code
    + They just have to pay for that...
* By default, you can put anything on GitHub for free as long as it is
under a fairly free-use (open source type) license and it is available to anyone
* If you want a private repository, as an academic affiliate you just have to ask
and GitHub will give you unlimited private repos for free.
* And if you are a student and you have not yet done so, 
go to [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
to sign up for your free student pack.  


## Using git through RStudio {#git-thru-rstudio}

* Now we can do a few things together to see how this works.
* Most of the action is in the Git Pane...
* Today we will talk about:
    + Staging files (preparing them to be __committed__)
    + Committing files (putting them into the repository)
    + viewing differences between staged and unstaged files
    + committing files
    + viewing the commit history
    

## The status/staging panel

![](images/rstudio-git-grab.png)

* RStudio keeps git constantly scanning the project directory to find any files
that have changed or which are new.
* By clicking a file's little "check-box" you can stage it.  
* Some symbols:
    + __Blue-M__: a file that is already under version control that has been modified.
    + __Yellow-?__: a file that is not under version control (yet...)
    + __Green-A__: a file that was not under version control, but which has been staged to be 
    committed.
    + __Red-D__: a file under version control has been deleted.  To make it really disappear, you have 
    to stage its disappearance and commit. Note that it still lives on, but you have to dig back
    into your history to find it.
    + __Purple-R__ a file that was renamed.  (Note that git in Rstudio seems to be
    figuring this out on its own.)
    
## The Diff window

* Shows what has changed between the last committed version of a file and its
current state.
* Holy smokes this is convenient!
* (Note: all this output is available from the command line, but
the Rstudio interface is very nice, IMHO)

## Making a Commit

* Super easy:
    + After staging the files you want to commit...
    + Write a brief message (first line short, then as much after that as you want)
    and hit the commit button.
    
## The History window

* Easy inspection of past commits.
* See what changes were made at each commit.

## Go for it everyone! {#git-play}
* Make some changes and commit them yourselves.  
* Add some new files to the project, and commit those.
* Get familiar with the diff window.
* Check the history after a few commits.


## How does git store and keep track of things {#git-how}

* Everything is stored in the .git folder inside the RStudio project.
* The "working copy" gets checkout out of there
* Committed changes are recorded to the directory

### What is inside of the .git directory?
We can use R to list the files.  It is going to look something
like this:
```{r list-git, eval=FALSE}
dir(path = ".git", all.files = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
```
```
  [1] "#MERGE_MSG#"                                       "COMMIT_EDITMSG"                                   
  [3] "COMMIT_EDITMSG~"                                   "config"

__Yikes!__

### How does git know a file has changed?

* Does it just look at the modification date?
* NO! It "fingerprints" every file, so it knows when it has changed from the most recent
committed version.
    + Demonstration.  Change a file. Save, then undo the change and save again...Git knows
    the file has been changed back to its "former self"
* SHA-1 hashes.  We will learn more about those later.  
* You will see things like `ed00c10ae6cf7bcc35d335d2edad7e71bc0f6770` all over in Git-land.
* You can treat them as very specific names for different commits (and files, etc.).

## What should I keep under version control?

**This is a Wildy Important Topic**

* General rule: **don't keep derived products**.
    + i.e. If you have an Rmd file that creates an html file, there isn't much need to put the html 
    file under version control with git, because you can just regenerate it by Knitting the Rmd file.
        - (Except when I want you to commit the html file for your homework so I can read it without knitting it)
* Do keep data and source code
* However, sometimes raw data is better kept on Google Drive, under password protection. 
    + Especially if your data files are large.
* Sometimes certain outputs and intermediate results from long calculations can be committed
so that you don't have to run a 4 hour analysis to start where you were before.
    + However, it is better IMHO to keep that locally, on your own computer, but not committed to git/GitHub.
    + For such results in R, consider `write_rds()` with the `compress = "xz"` option (and its companion `read_rds())

    
### How can I make git ignore certain files?

It is best to set git up so that you don't "accidentally" commit a whole bunch of files
that you don't want to

* Use the `.gitignore` file!
* File names (and patterns) in the `.gitignore` file are ignored _recursively_ (down into subdirectories), 
by default.
* Files won't be ignored if they are already in the repository.
* Example: `*.html`, `outputs`, `intermediates`
* Note a preceding slash to operate only on the directory that the gitignore file is in:
`/*.html`, `/outputs`, `/intermediates`
* RStudio makes it very easy to add files to your `.gitignore` (and will make one for each subdirectory...)


## Pushing and Pulling With GitHub

### Creating a Repository on GitHub and the initial push

When you have an RStudio project under git version control on your laptop or desktop computer, 
creating a remote repository on GitHub is quite easy.  A few steps:

1. Upper right corner: "create new" button (a "+" with a little triangle.)  Choose "New Repository"
1. Give it a name.  It makes most sense to name it the same as the RStudio project you want to push 
up there. So, for example, if my project file was `boing.Rproj`, I would name the repository `boing`.
1. Add a 5 or 6 word description if you want.
1. Choose __public__ or __private__
1. DO __NOT__ choose to "Initialize this repository with a README".  You likely already have a README. 
Initializing the repository with one will create headaches.
1. Also, don't add a `.gitignore` or a license (select "none", which should be the default, for both of those)
1. Click the green "Create Repository" button

That will take you to another screen.  In the middle find the code box 
below the heading, __…or push an existing repository from the command line__.

1. Copy that two lines of code from you web browser.  It will look something like this:
    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/eriqande/boing.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```
    but it will be specific to the repository you just made, so the URL and name of the repo will
    be different than what you see above.  Note, you can copy the lines by clicking the
    "copy this text" icon on the right side of the page.
1. Go to RStudio, in the project that you want to push to GitHub, and open a terminal window (Tools -> Terminal -> New Terminal).  That
will give you a terminal window with a working directory set to the project directory.  Paste the commands you copied into that terminal window
and hit return.
1. It might ask you for your GitHub username and password.

Voila!

### Subsequent pushes

Once you have pushed the repo up there.  Try making some changes on your laptop,
committing them, and then hitting the "Push" button on the git panel...

## A first look at Forking and Pull Requests

* Armed with a GitHub account, you can recommend changes/edits to repositories on GitHub.
* To do so, you 
    - "fork" the repository (clone the repo to you own account on GitHub)
    - "clone" your "fork" to your laptop.
    - Make edits. Then commit them (possibly in a new "branch")
    - Prepare a pull request.
* This process is a little involved, but...
* It happens fairly naturally and easily for my course materials (lectures and course website) if you use the edit button. 

## Getting Ready for Next Week

* We have an obscene amount of material to get through next week.
* Please read the whole [ECA-bioinf-handbook-Chapter-4](https://eriqande.github.io/eca-bioinf-handbook/essential-unixlinux-terminal-knowledge.html) before coming to class on Tuesday.
    - Quiz yourself on the review table at the end of the chapter.
