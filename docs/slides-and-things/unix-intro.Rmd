## Paths 1

* Absolute paths start with `/`
* On a Unix system, `/` is the "root" directory.  (Sort of like `C:\\` on Windows...)
* Typically you won't use absolute paths much in your research repositories because _they are not reproducible_.

## Paths 2

* A relative path is a path that does not start with `/`. 
* Where it points is relative to the _current working directory_.
* `..` means "up one level"

## Paths 3

* Your home directory is where you will "start your day" in Unix,
    - Also where you will spend most of your time.
* Its absolute path will be something like `/home/eriq` or `/Users/eriq` or whatever.  But you can always use `~` to mean "my home directory"
* `~/Documents/git-repos`

## A First Configuration (and a chance to learn a simple text editor called `nano`)

### Modify your `.bash_profile`

```sh
# make sure you are in home directory
cd

# now edit your .bash_profile
nano .bash_profile
```
If you don't have anything in your .bash_profile then add these lines,
exit (^X) and save:
```sh

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi

```
If you do have something in your bash profile already, talk to me first.


### Modify your `.bashrc`

```sh
nano .bashrc
```

Then add this line (and maybe the others) and save it:
```sh
export PS1='[\W]--% '

# on windows you might want to add this:
alias ls='ls --color'
```


### Make that active

```sh
source .bashrc
```

Now you command prompt should be less ugly.

## `cd` and `ls`

### For moving amongst directories

* `cd` _path_ changes directory.  
* With no argument (_path_) it returns you to your home directory
* `cd -` returns you to the last directory you were in

### For listing what is in directories:

* `ls` _path_
* Important options to `ls`:
    - `-l`  :  long output
    - `-a`  :  show hidden files
    - `-d`  :  list name of directory only, not contents
    - `-R`  :  recursively show all subdirectories and their contents
    - `-lrt` : three options bunged together! long listing 
    of files (`l`), in reverse order (`r`) sorted by time (`t`).
    


## TAB Completion

* It is the only way to survive on the command line.
* TAB early. TAB often.

## The `open` command on a Mac (and on Windows in the RStudio Terminal)

* Macs have a great little command called `open`
* Not a standard Unix command, but super useful on your own laptop.
* Use it like: `open` _path_.
* The effect is like "double-clicking" _path_ in the Finder window.
* `open .` opens a Finder window set to the current working directory.
* `open a-project.Rproj` opens the project in RStudio.
* `open document.docx` opens `document` in MS Word.
* `open some-document.html` opens an HTML file on your computer in your default browser.
* etc.

## `open` command on Windows

* This is provided by R, apparently.  
* It works by default in RStudio Unix Terminals.
* If you want this in your Command Prompt shell, you can add
this line to your `.bashrc` file:
```sh
alias open='/c/Program Files/R/R-3.6.2/bin/x64/open"
```

## Take the Command Line Pledge!

Raise your right hand and repeat after me:

_I do solemnly swear to forsake use of the Finder window on Mac or the File Explorer on Windows for all but the occasional trivial task. I know that I can navigate anywhere on my laptop using the Unix command line. I shall not yield to the temptation of a simple point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), but shall persevere in the name of becoming an expert at TAB completion, path navigation, globbing, and the use of `cd`, `ls`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm`.  I shall refrain from double-clicking upon a file for the remainder of the semester, choosing instead the salubrious method of using the `open` command.  I recognize that I am a recovering GUI user, and that I will always be one, and, as such, I am not able to safely "use the Finder window just a little bit." It is in my best interests as a scientist/researcher/data analyst/bioinformatician to, from this day forward, navigate my laptop's file system from the Unix shell._

It sounds a little silly, but if you do prohibit yourself from using 
the Finder Window / File Explorer on your laptop, and instead
force yourself to navigate
it from your Unix shell, you will quickly become proficient at that.

That turns out to be a crucial skill for doing bioinformatics.

Eventually, you will be astounded by how inefficient the Finder window feels.

Now, take 10 minutes to play around with that.
