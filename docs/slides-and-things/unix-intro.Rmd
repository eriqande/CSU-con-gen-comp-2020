## First, some wrap up from the About-Me assignments

* Pull Requests for everyone  (Show One...)
    - You all should merge those on GitHub
    - Then Pull them down to your laptop
    - Re-knit your document etc.
    - Note, if you made any changes you might need to commit before pulling
    and even then you might get a merge conflict.
    
* Hard line endings in RMarkdown
    - The RStudio editor soft wraps lines in .Rmd documents.
    - This seems convenient, but is a huge hassle if you are using GitHub.
        + Why?
    - Still no non-soft-wrap option: [https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/2341](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/2341)
    - In the meantime, just make sure you have line numbers all down the left
    side of your docs if you are doing to be collaboratively writing something
    via GitHub.

```


## Paths 1

* Absolute paths start with `/`
* On a Unix system, `/` is the "root" directory.  (Sort of like `C:\\` on Windows...)
* Typically you won't use absolute paths much in your research repositories because _they are not reproducible_.

## Paths 2

* A relative path is a path that does not start with `/`. 
* Where it points is relative to the _current working directory_.
* `..` means "up one level"

## Paths 3

* Your home directory is where you will "start your day" in Unix,
    - Also where you will spend most of your time.
* Its absolute path will be something like `/home/eriq` or `/Users/eriq` or whatever.  But you can always use `~` to mean "my home directory"
* `~/Documents/git-repos`

## A First Configuration (and a chance to learn a simple text editor called `nano`)

### Modify your `.bash_profile`

```sh
# make sure you are in home directory
cd

# now edit your .bash_profile
nano .bash_profile
```
If you don't have anything in your .bash_profile then add these lines,
exit (^X) and save:
```sh

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi

```
If you do have something in your bash profile already, talk to me first.


### Modify your `.bashrc`

```sh
nano .bashrc
```

Then add this line (and maybe the others) and save it:
```sh
export PS1='[\W]--% '

# on windows you might want to add this:
alias ls='ls --color'
```


### Make that active

```sh
source .bashrc
```

Now, your command prompt should be less ugly.

## `cd` and `ls`

### For moving amongst directories

* `cd` _path_ changes directory.  
* With no argument (_path_) it returns you to your home directory
* `cd -` returns you to the last directory you were in

### For listing what is in directories:

* `ls` _path_
* Important options to `ls`:
    - `-l`  :  long output
    - `-a`  :  show hidden files
    - `-d`  :  list name of directory only, not contents
    - `-R`  :  recursively show all subdirectories and their contents
    - `-lrt` : three options bunged together! long listing 
    of files (`l`), in reverse order (`r`) sorted by time (`t`).
    


## TAB Completion

* It is the only way to survive on the command line.
* TAB early. TAB often.

## The `open` command on a Mac (and on Windows in the RStudio Terminal)

* Macs have a great little command called `open`
* Not a standard Unix command, but super useful on your own laptop.
* Use it like: `open` _path_.
* The effect is like "double-clicking" _path_ in the Finder window.
* `open .` opens a Finder window set to the current working directory.
* `open a-project.Rproj` opens the project in RStudio.
* `open document.docx` opens `document` in MS Word.
* `open some-document.html` opens an HTML file on your computer in your default browser.
* etc.

## `open` command on Windows

* This is provided by R, apparently.  
* It works by default in RStudio Unix Terminals.
* If you want this in your Command Prompt shell, you can add
this line to your `.bashrc` file:
```sh
alias open='/c/Program Files/R/R-3.6.2/bin/x64/open'
```

## Take the Command Line Pledge!

Raise your right hand and repeat after me:

_I do solemnly swear to forsake use of the Finder window on Mac or the File Explorer on Windows for all but the occasional trivial task. I know that I can navigate anywhere on my laptop using the Unix command line. I shall not yield to the temptation of a simple point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), but shall persevere in the name of becoming an expert at TAB completion, path navigation, globbing, and the use of `cd`, `ls`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm`.  I shall refrain from double-clicking upon a file for the remainder of the semester, choosing instead the salubrious method of using the `open` command.  I recognize that I am a recovering GUI user, and that I will always be one, and, as such, I am not able to safely "use the Finder window just a little bit." It is in my best interests as a scientist/researcher/data analyst/bioinformatician to, from this day forward, navigate my laptop's file system from the Unix shell._

It sounds a little silly, but if you do prohibit yourself from using 
the Finder Window / File Explorer on your laptop, and instead
force yourself to navigate
it from your Unix shell, you will quickly become proficient at that.

That turns out to be a crucial skill for doing bioinformatics.

Eventually, you will be astounded by how inefficient the Finder window feels.

Now, take 10 minutes to play around with that.

## Play with `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`

...But please be very careful!


## Make a new directory

```sh
mkdir a-new-directory
```

## Practice "Globbing" with the `ls` function

To practice globbing, it is always nice to use it with `ls` because
`ls` will never delete or move files, etc.

`*` is the most permissive wildcard.  It matches anything.

1. Use `*` to pick out all `.jpg` files in a directory.
2. Then modify that and pick out all PDF files.
3. Then be more selective and pick out all PDF files that start with `a` for example, etc.

`?` is a wildcard that fills in for any single letter

1. Find some files that you can pick out as a group using `?`

`[` and `]` let you pick out single character ranges.

Try this. It will make 20 files in `temp_dir`
```{sh}
cd 
mkdir -p temp_dir
cd temp_dir
for i in {1..20}; do
  echo $i > ${i}-file.txt
done
```

Now try to list just the first 5 or the ones that are in the
teens, etc.  For example, just the teens:
```{sh}
cd ~/temp_dir
ls 1[3-9]-file.txt
```

## Anatomy of a Unix Command

`command` _options_ _arguments_

Example:

```sh
ls -l this_directory
```

What is the command, which part is the option(s) and which part is the argument(s)?


## Getting information about Unix commands

Use `man command` like:

```sh 
man grep
```
or 
```sh
man ls
```
or
```sh
man tar
```

Some of these are extensive.  It typically gets viewed in the `less` viewer:

- space-bar to go further down the page
- b to go back up.
- q to quit.



## File and directory name conventions

This should be another pledge:

Use only upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, dots `.`, underscores `_`, and dashes `-`.

Never use spaces in your file names again!

* Space is a standard token separator on the command line, which makes it hard to deal with spaces in file names.
* Don't use `?`, `\`, `:`, etc.


## `echo` : print argument to _stdout_

Try it:
```sh
echo "Woo hoo!"
```

Try some more things:
```sh
echo $PATH
```

Ooh!

## Redirect _stdout_ to a file

Try this:
```sh
ls -l ~ > /tmp/myfile.txt
head /tmp/myfile.txt
wc /tmp/myfile.txt
du -h /tmp/myfile.txt
```

Break down the first command.  What is it doing? Where does the redirection happen?

How about the next few lines? What do people think
this is going to do?



## Pipe _stdout_ to another command

What happens when we do this:
```sh
ls -l ~ | wc 
```



## THURSDAY Administrative stuff, etc.:

1. Homework is due Friday at 5 PM
    - I will give out a key over the weekend.
    - I am contemplating having each student "grade" (i.e., comment on GitHub via a pull request) another (random) student's homework.
    - If you won't have your homework done and available for communal grading by Saturday noon, please email me.
    
2. I have put the link to the course [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/CSU-con-gen-bioinformatics-2020) page here, and also at the bottom of the main course web page.

3. Unix/Windows foibles
    - Use `sha1sum` for `shasum` on Windows
    - Use `zcat` for `gzcat` on Windows.
    - Brenna, still having `chmod` issues on windows?
    
4. How are people feeling about permission bits.

5. Plan for today.  
  a. Answer questions that came up.
  b. Maybe spend more time on permission bits and bit-masks.
  c. Talk about tibbles and the 'readr' package (we will work this into looking at some teeny genomic data files.)
  
  
  
## tibbles
  
* Hadley's answer to `data.frame`s. (i.e. these are the Tidyverse equivalent of data frames).
* Why tibbles? Aren't they just data frames?
    - Yes and no.
    - Print method for tibbles is WAAAAY better.
        + won't bomb your screen.
        + won't spend minutes calculating column widths
        + Won't wrap extra columns around.
        + Gives data types in the header
        + Tells you the names of additional columns that may not have been printed (up to a point)
    - The `tibble()` constructor plays nicely with lists of the appropriate length. YAY List Columns!
    -  The `tibble()` constructor is "surly" and doesn't let you do things that you probably don't want it to.
* Everyone do this in R in your `unix-play-with-genomic-data` RStudio project:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
sammy <- read_tsv("sam/DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.sam", comment = "@", col_names = FALSE)
```

You will see some warnings when you do that. We will talk about those later.

Now, print `sammy` by doing:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sammy
```
and discuss.  

## R's very own pipe operator

* Yesterday we talked about Unix's `|` which, when used like this:
```sh
left_comm | right_comm
```
takes _stdout_ from the command on the left side (`left_comm` in this case)
and sends it as _stdin_ to the command on the right side (`right_comm` in this case)

Example:
```sh
ls -l | wc
```

R lacked this type of functionality for many years.
For anyone who had ever worked comfortably in Unix for a long time, and was
used to chaining the output of one command in as the input for another command
using pipes, R's syntax for composition of functions was always super
cumbersome and required all sorts of nasty, nested parentheses.  

Consider this simple set of operations: imagine we want to

1. simulate 1000 gamma random variables, $G$, with parameters $\alpha=5$ and $\beta = 1$,
1. for each $G$ simulate a Poisson random variable with mean (`lambda`) $G$.
1. take the `sqrt` of each such variable
1. compute the variance of the result

This can all be done in one line, but is ugly!

```{r sim-pipe, echo=TRUE}
# set random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(5)

var(sqrt(rpois(n = 1000, lambda = rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 5, scale = 1))))
```

It doesn't matter how stylishly you include spaces in your code, this is just Fugly!

You can write it on multiple lines, but it is friggin' ghastly! Maybe worse than before.
```{r sim-pipe-multiline, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(5)

var(
  sqrt(
    rpois(n = 1000, lambda = rgamma(
      n = 1000, shape = 5, scale = 1
    )
    )
  )
)
```

The problem is that the order in which the operations are done does not match 
the way things are written: the first thing to get done is the call to `rgamma`,
which is nested deeply within the parentheses.

Enter the R "pipe" symbol.  It is not as convenient to type as `|`, but you can
make it quickly with the keyboard shortcut `cmd-shift-M`:  `%>%`.  This was introduced
in the `magrittr` package, and the `tidyverse` imports the `%>%` symbol from `magrittr`.  

Behold!
```{r true-pipe, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(5)

rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 5, scale = 1) %>%
  rpois(n = 1000, lambda = .) %>%          # pass G is as the lambda parameter using the dot: .
  sqrt() %>%                               # no dot here, so the previous result is just the first argument to sqrt
  var()                                    # same here
```
That is a hell of a lot easier to read!  It gives me goose bumps it is so elegant.

The `%>%` symbol says, "take the result that occurred before the `%>%` and pass it in as the `.` in whatever follows
the `%>%`."  Furthermore, if there is no `.` in the expression after the `%>%`, simply pass 
the result that occurred before the `%>%` in as the _first argument_ in the function call that comes after the `%>%`.

This type of "chaining" of operations is particularly powerful when operating on `tibbles` using `dplyr`


## Why is chaining with the pipe helpful?

* Code is easier to read and follow (and comment)
* Much Easier to build up steps in an analysis and test/inspect each result along the way.
    - Particularly with tibbles.  You can easily look at each step along the way.
* Consider building up the above steps in a tibble.
* Note that function `tibble()` is the "Tibble Constructor".  It assembles vectors, of the same length,
into a tibble.  Syntax = `column_name = column_contents`).
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
tibble(gammas = rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 5, scale = 1))
```

Then:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
tibble(gammas = rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 5, scale = 1)) %>%
  mutate(poissons = rpois(n = n(), lambda = gammas))
```
Whoa! No quotation marks around column names.

And so forth.


## The `View()` command

Every wanted a better look at your tibble?

```r
View(sammy)

# or, more usefully in workflows:
sammy %>% View()
```

Note!  Huge tibbles can bog down your View...

## `readr` a Tidyverse package for reading files.

The functions in this package provide replacements for many base-R functions, like
`read.table`, `read.delim`, `read.csv`.  

Why use the readr functions:

* More uniform interface/syntax.
* Faster
* stringsAsFactors = FALSE, always.  
* Also a little "surly".  Gives you informative warnings.
* Automatically puts the data in a tibble.

The readr equivalents are often named like the base-R functions, but the
`.` is replaced by an `_`:

In my experience, the most useful are:

* `read_csv`
* `read_tsv`
* `read_table2`
* `read_lines`

There are also equivalents to write:

* `write_csv`
* `write_tsv`

are my favorites.

## Break this down

```r
sammy <- read_tsv("sam/DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.sam", comment = "@", col_names = FALSE)
```

What is up with the warnings?

Try
```r
problems(sammy)
```

Cool! It returns a report in a tibble!
